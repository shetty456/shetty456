# Sunil Hanamshetty 🌿

I’m a **product-minded engineer** with a background in software development, product strategy, and entrepreneurship. I’ve been writing code professionally since 2021 — building everything from educational apps to real-time systems and scalable backends.

Today, I work at the intersection of **backend architecture**, **developer tooling**, and **product thinking**, helping teams ship thoughtful, high-quality software that scales.

I’ve worn many hats: founder, engineer, teacher, and now, a rising **product leader** — with a deep belief that technology, when built with heart, can truly change lives. ✨
